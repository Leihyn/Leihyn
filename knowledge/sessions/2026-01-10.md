### 8. Created Phase 5 Guide (Building)
- Created: `knowledge/zk-phase5-building.md`
- Four capstone projects:
  1. ZK Membership Proof (Circom + Solidity)
  2. Private Voting with Semaphore
  3. Confidential DeFi (dark pool / auction / lending)
  4. Open Source Contribution
- Career paths and staying current section
- Technology selection quick reference
