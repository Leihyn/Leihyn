Runnable Python exercises for each phase.

## Setup

```bash
pip install py_ecc numpy
```

## Phase 1: Foundations

| File | Topic | Run |
|------|-------|-----|
| `phase1/week1_groups.py` | Groups & modular arithmetic | `python phase1/week1_groups.py` |
| `phase1/week3_elliptic_curves.py` | Elliptic curves with py_ecc | `python phase1/week3_elliptic_curves.py` |
| `phase1/week5_polynomials.py` | Lagrange interpolation | `python phase1/week5_polynomials.py` |

## How to Use

1. Read the corresponding guide in `knowledge/zk-phase1-foundations.md`
2. Run the exercise file to see the concepts in action
3. Modify the code, fill in TODOs, experiment
4. Check off items in `zk-study-tracker.md`

## Exercise Structure

Each file contains:
- **Theory section**: Explains the concept with code
- **TODO exercises**: Implement functions yourself
- **Solutions**: Uncomment to check your work
- **Checkpoint questions**: Verify understanding
