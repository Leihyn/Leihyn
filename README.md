## Featured Projects

### [Privacy Chronicles](https://github.com/Leihyn/cosmic-comics) - Developer Advocacy & Technical Education Platform
**Content Creation Track Winner | [Zypherpunk Hackathon](https://zypherpunk.xyz/) | Zcash Foundation**

<details>
<summary><b>View Technical Details</b></summary>

**The problem:** Privacy protocols have excellent documentation. Technical specs. Whitepapers. Almost nobody reads them. You can't document someone into caring.

**The solution:** An immersive comic experience that makes abstract privacy concepts concrete and personal. "Stories are Trojan horses for ideas."

**Technical Content Creation:**
- 5-episode comic series (70+ illustrated pages) explaining zero-knowledge proofs, shielded transactions, and financial privacy
- Each episode covers a different social class: daily wage worker, middle class family, tech founder, wealthy elite, activist
- Demonstrates privacy violations through narrative before introducing solutions (Zcash, Aztec, Miden, Nillion)
- Narrative architecture designed to make privacy personal, not political

**Immersive 3D Experience (React Three Fiber):**
- Solar system navigation where each planet represents a comic episode
- Orbital mechanics, particle systems, and smooth camera animations
- Custom Three.js integration with responsive design
- "You're not being handed content. You're finding it."

**Accessibility-First Voice Narration:**
- Cinematic narration scripts for every page (100+ custom narrations)
- Morgan Freeman-style audio storytelling layered on visual storytelling
- Auto-play audio that follows page navigation
- Designed for visually impaired users, commuters, and educators presenting to groups

**Reader Experience:**
- Page-flip physics with realistic shadows and sound effects
- Progress tracking across episodes
- Controls that get out of the way when not needed
- "Polish isn't about impressing people. It's about removing friction."

**DevRel Impact:** Translates complex cryptographic concepts into accessible narratives that drive ecosystem awareness without oversimplifying the technology.
